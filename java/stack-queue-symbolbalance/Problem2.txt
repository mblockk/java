The enqueue operation of my Two Stack Queue is O(1) because it is simply adding
a file to the top of the stack which already has a reference in java's Linked List
class. The dequeue operation is, in the worst case, O(N), but only when the dequeue
stack is empty. When it is empty, S2 has to push each of S1's popped elements on to
itself. But, when it has elements already, each call to dequeue is O(1) because
it simply pops one from the top of the dequeue stack.
